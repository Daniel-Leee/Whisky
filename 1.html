  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisky#American" target="_blank" title="American whisky specification">American whiskey</a> is
    <strong>distilled from a fermented mash of <u>cereal grain</u>.</strong> It must have the taste, aroma, and other characteristics commonly attributed to whiskey.</P>
  <p>Some types of whiskey listed in the United States federal regulations are:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Bourbon whiskey—made from mash that consists of at least 51% corn (maize) and aged in new charred oak barrels.</li>
    <li>Corn whiskey—made from mash that consists of at least 80% corn and is not aged, or, if aged, is aged in uncharred or used barrels.</li>
    <li>Malt whiskey—made from mash that consists of at least 51% malted barley</li>
    <li>Rye whiskey—made from mash that consists of at least 51% rye</li>
    <li>Rye malt whiskey—made from mash that consists of at least 51% malted rye</li>
    <li>Wheat whiskey—made from mash that consists of at least 51% wheat</li></P>
  </ul>
  <p>These types of American whiskey must be distilled to no more than 80% alcohol by volume, and barrelled at no more than 125 proof. Only water may be added to the final product; the addition of colouring or flavouring is prohibited. These whiskeys must be aged in new charred-oak containers, except for corn whiskey which does not have to be aged. If it is aged, it must be in uncharred oak barrels or in used barrels. Corn whiskey is usually unaged and sold as a legal version of moonshine.</p>
